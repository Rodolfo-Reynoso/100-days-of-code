# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 12, 2020 
##### (CSS Grid)

**Today's Progress**: Learned a bit about css grid trying to copy a simple image.

**Thoughts:** I thought it was going to be easy to learn. I was wrong. But i'm glad I worked on the app. I'll need to keep working on it to get a better understanding of CSS Grid.
